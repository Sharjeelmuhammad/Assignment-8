  <strong>
The United States announced on Friday it was <br><a href="" class="a1">revoking the designation</a> of Yemen’s Houthi <br>rebels as a terrorist group effective February 16,<br> a reversal by the Biden administration which <br> was welcomed by the United Nations and <br> humanitarian groups who feared former <br>president Donald Trump’s actions would <br> impede aid deliveries to the conflict-torn <br> country facing the world’s worst humanitarian <br>crisis.</strong> <br> US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called <br> President Joe Biden’s decision to rescind the <br> designation “a recognition of the dire <br>humanitarian situation in Yemen”. He said the <br> new US administration listened to warnings from <br> the United Nations, humanitarian groups, <br>bipartisan members of Congress and others “that <br /> the designations could have a devastating <br> impact on Yemenis’ access to basic commodities <br>like food and fuel”.<br>
Yemen imports 90 per cent of its food, nearly all <br> purchased through commercial channels, and <br>UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warned last <br> month that the US designation of the Houthis <br> already had companies pulling back from <br>dealing with the Yemenis and would likely lead to <br> “a large-scale famine on a scale that we have <br> not seen for nearly 40 years”. <br>
Blinken’s announcement followed a phone <br>conversation on Thursday with UN Secretary <br>-General Antonio Guterres, where Yemen was one <br> of the issues they discussed. UN spokesman <br>Stephane Dujarric on Friday called the US action <br> “extremely positive”. “We hope that helps build <br> momentum for a political solution to the conflict <br> in Yemen,” Dujarric said. “I think the reversal of the <br>designation, the naming of the [US] special envoy <br> [for Yemen], and the clear, clear language from <br> the top of the administration, from president <br> Biden himself, expressing his strong support for <br>the UN-led mediation process [...] are very, very <br>welcome indeed.” <br>
In 2014, the rebel Houthis overran the capital,<br> Sanaa, and much of Yemen’s north, driving the <br> government into exile. A US-backed, Saudi-led <br> coalition intervened the following year to try and <br> restore the internationally recognised <br> government, but years of UN efforts to get both <br> sides to agree to a ceasefire and start peace <br> negotiations have not succeeded. The conflict <br />has been disastrous for Yemen, the Arab world’s <br> poorest country, killing more than 112,000 people,<br> creating a humanitarian disaster, and wrecking <br> infrastructure from roads and hospitals to water <br> and electricity networks.<br>
The State Department confirmed last week that <br>Biden was moving to revoke the designation, a <br> day after the president announced an end to <br>offensive support to Saudi Arabia’s campaign <br>against the Houthis.
